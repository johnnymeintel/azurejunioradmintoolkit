## 📚 Learning Approach

Each script in this toolkit follows a "learn-by-doing" approach:

1. **Heavily Commented Code**: Every line is explained in plain language
2. **Safety Mechanisms**: Confirmation prompts and error handling to prevent mistakes
3. **Learning Notes**: Exam-relevant explanations directly in the comments
4. **Modular Design**: Start with basic operations, then gradually explore more complex scenarios
